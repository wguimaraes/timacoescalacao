# Timaço Escalação

## Summary

This is a simple app project that I am developing to learn about GetX on Flutter. My idea is to combine utility with leisure by making an app to manage informal group competitions of sand volleyball.

## This is an ongoing project

This project is in its beginning stages, so many functionalities and screens may not be complete or may only have a scaffold. I haven't decided yet if I will make the app store data locally or consume data from an API.

## About this project
The main goal is to manage games, add/edit players, add/edit games, sort teams, and make simple brackets sorted randomly in the first step. In the next steps, prioritize teams that have not confronted each other yet. After that, organize teams that have won the most to confront each other and teams that have lost more to confront each other.
